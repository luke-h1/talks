Now I know some of you might be wondering why I'm talking about a mobile routing framework in a web dev talk. Well, I'm going to walk you through how you can use your own existing skills as a web dev to build not only really native feeling mobile apps, but really great websites all from the same react-native codebase. Evan bacon the creator of expo-router puts it really well, 'expo honors the platform', and from using expo for quite a while now I agree with it. Whether you're using expo for android, IOS, web or even TV it excels at doing the right thing for the right platform
