<!--
It uses very familiar web APIs to handle routing needs such as link and href to handle navigation between screens. It also has a router hook to access things like the current route, pushing to new routes. If you've used Next.js or even just react-router, this should feel very familiar. My understanding is that the expo-router team took a lot of inspiration from how web frameworks built their routing tooling and applied that to expo router. Finally we also have a handy hook called useLocalSearchParams to access any dynamic route params we might want to access.
