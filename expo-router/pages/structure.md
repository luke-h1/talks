So to start off with we've done our intro, we'll take a look at some resources and qr codes you can scan to see some of what we'll be building in action. We'll be covering some terminology to make sure we're all on the same page. Then we'll be looking into react navigation and expo router, comparing the two, building apps and websites with it and then we'll wrap up with a conclusion.
