Before we get started, I just wanted to cover a few aspects before we get into the main topic. Don't worry if you've not used React Native or even routing frameworks like Next.js before, they're are both quite intuitive and lean quite a lot on the web concepts that you're probably already familiar with. We'll be covering the basics and then diving into the details of expo-router.

Why are you talking about a mobile routing framework in a web dev talk? We'll the creator of expo-router, evan bacon says that expo-router is a platform agnostic routing framework. This means that it can be used on any platform, not just mobile. And in general expo cares a hell of a lot about doing the right thing for the right platform. It works well on web, mobile, desktop and even things like tv and wearables
