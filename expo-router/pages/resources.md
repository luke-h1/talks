We're going to be building two apps today. A static blog app and a movie app. Feel free to scan these qr codes and give it a go. If you're on IOS you will need to download the testflight app first and then scan the QR code. Now you may notice that there is only an ios and web link. Why not android? well google are unfortunately very restrictive around what they allow you to publish. In order to provide an open test link that you can scan with a QR code, I'd have to invite 12 internal testers to test the app for a minimum of 2 weeks. And even then they may reject you. So it was just easier to not include the android link. The apps all work on Android, if you want to try it out you can download the codebases and run it locally.
