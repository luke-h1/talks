I like to use the airbnb app as an example of stack navigation. You can see here that we have a home tab and we can navigate to a listing screen from the explore tab. within that listing screen we can navigate to a the host profile screen. We can also navigate to the review screen. All while being in the explore tab. Does that make sense to everyone? Just wanted to make sure because when I was learning stack navigation it was a bit confusing at first coming from web
